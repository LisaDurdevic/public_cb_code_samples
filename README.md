# public_cb_code_samples
Some random code samples I did in CodersBay to show how my way of coding changed during progress. 

If you compare the SQL task 1 with task 10 and the 'Joins'-task you quickly see how I worked on writing as readable as possible, using comment lines for seperating the tasks optically.

The same at JAVA, where I learned not only to use comments and readable structures but also to write absolutely everything in english.
Of course, as we learned more, I used more effective ways and methods to match the expectations.

From the very beginning everyone keeps telling me it is so much easier for me because of my prior experiences.
But honestly, I think it isn't the experience but the personal work ethic. Because almost everyone here has prior experiences or at least more technical knowledge than me.

During this education I learned how big the difference is in taking the time to learn theory, thinking about your program and having some plan BEFORE you start to write your code rather than just start coding and see whatever happens. And not to be lazy putting some effort into clean coding. The time you 'loose' at the beginning comes back in quicker and better results which not just one time helped others to understand the tasks.

This way at the end of the day my progress was as fast as stable.
